===================

My first repo
I am trying to get some fundamental ideas how exactly this github works. I made a comment line when first time i made a local repo in my computer. Than i push that in my remote repo, in github. 
Now this is my second attemp to change things from remote. And still i am looking how to push, pull and fork the repo either way. 
   Also I made the heading of my repo different than told to make and tried to edit but i lost somewhere in middle of the process. So i am working from the point i stop in reverse way. Lets see it works or not.
